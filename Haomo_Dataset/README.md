# Haomo Dataset

## Introduction
We provide such a new challenging dataset called **Haomo dataset** to support future research. The dataset was collected by a mobile robot built by [HAOMO.AI Technology company](https://github.com/haomo-ai) equipped with a HESAI PandarXT 32-beam LiDAR sensor in urban environments of Beijing. There are currently five sequences in Haomo dataset as listed in Tab. I. Sequences 1-1 and 1-2 are collected from the same route in 8th December 2021 with opposite driving direction. An additional sequence 1-3 from the same route is utilized as the online query with respect to both 1-1 and 1-2 respectively to evaluate place recognition performance of forward and reverse driving.  

Sequences 2-1 and 2-2 are collected along a much longer route from the same direction, but on different dates, 2-1 on 28th December 2021 and 2-2 on 13th January 2022, where the old one is used as a database while the newer one is used as query. The two sequences are for evaluating the performance for large-scale long-term place recognition.

This dataset will be frequently updated to include highly dynamic and constantly updated traffic scenes. More different types of sensor data are also planned to be included.

## Format

* **[scans]** contains all .bin files of recorded point clouds from the 32-beam LiDAR.
* **[poses]** contains the local poses of the LiDAR sensor.
* **[transformation between the first poses]** contains the transformation matrix between the first poses of two trajectories. (e.g., transformation matrix of Seq 1-3 is T<sub>1-3-0</sub><sup>-1</sup>Â·T<sub>1-1-0</sub>)

Our dataset follows the data format of [KITTI odometry benchmark](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).
